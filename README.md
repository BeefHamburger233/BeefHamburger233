- 👋 Hello, I’m @BeefHamburger233,I come from JIECITY, a personal organization in China!
- 👀 I'm interested in discussing the knowledge of Java or other programming languages with you.
- 🌱 I’m currently learing Java and C.
- 💞️ I'm currently learning some basic knowledge of the Java language, so I am not looking for partners, but if you are willing to communicate with me, I am very happy.
